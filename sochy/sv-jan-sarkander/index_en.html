      <h1>Statue of St. Jan Sarkander</h1>

      <p>St. Jan Sarkander was a priest who was born in Silesia in Skočov (Skoczów in Poland now), worked in Holešov.
        At that time there was a Protestant environment there. During the conflict between Northern Moravia and the
        Polish Cossacks, he was wrongly accused of inviting them to our land. He was tortured and succumbed to his
        wounds in 1620. He was always considered a saint, although he was not officially canonized until 1995.</p>

      <p>The statue was part of the original Saxon (now Roosevelt) bridge over the Mže river. It was designed by the
        Pilsen baroque sculptor Lazar Widemann or his workshop.</p>
