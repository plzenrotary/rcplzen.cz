      <h1>Statue of St. Roch</h1>

      <p>St. Roch lived from 1293 to 1327. He was born in Southern France. At the age of 20,
        he gave away his great fortune to the poor and set off on a pilgrimage to Rome. During his journey
        he treated the sick with the plague until he became infected himself. He returned to Southern France,
        but his family did not accept him, they considered him a rogue. He died in prison as a fraud.
        He is a patron saint of the sick and a protector against the plague.</p>

      <p>The statue stood on the cemetery wall around the church on today's Republic Square until 1782,
        then it was placed on a house in Roosevelt Street. The author of the sculpture is unknown,
        but it is believed to be a work from the workshop of the Pilsen sculptor Lazar Widemann.</p>
