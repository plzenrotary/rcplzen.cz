      <h1>Statue of St. Francis of Assisi</h1>

      <p>St. Francis lived in Umbria in Italy, from 1182 to 1226. The son from a wealthy family devoted himself
        to ascetic life, he founded a brotherhood of like-minded people. The fraternity became an order of Friars Minor -
        Minorities. St. Francis is one of the people who most influenced the thought and philosophy of Christianity.
        He considered respect and love for people and nature to be important. He is the patron saint of Franciscans,
        the disabled, the ecologists and the environment.</p>

      <p>The statue originally decorated the second Prague Bridge over the Radbuza river, called U JÃ¡na, until 1861,
        when the sculptural decoration was removed and the statue of St. Francis moved to the Saxon (now Roosevelt) bridge.
        The author of the statue is unknown.</p>
