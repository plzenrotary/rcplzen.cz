      <h1>Statue of St. John of Nepomuk</h1>

      <p>St. John of Nepomuk lived from 1350 to 1393. He studied in Prague and Padua.
        He became a notary and later vicar general of the Archbishop of Prague, i.e. his deputy.
        He fell victim to the wrath of King Wenceslaus IV, who had him tortured in revenge for thwarting
        his intentions. Already dead, he was thrown from the Charles Bridge into the Vltava river.
        Since then, he has been worshiped as a saint, although he was not officially canonized until 1729.
        He is a patron saint of everything related to water, especially the protector against floods.
        He is the most famous Czech saint in the world..</p>

      <p>The statue was placed at the Imperial Gate (at the end of Prešovská Street) on a bridge over a moat.
        The author of the statue is unknown.</p>
