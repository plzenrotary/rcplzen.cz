      <h1>Statue of St. Jude Thaddaeuss</h1>

      <p>St. Judas Thaddeus was one of the twelve apostles who accompanied Jesus Christ on his travels in Palestine.
        He was slain with a club in Persia around the year 70, so the club became his attribute. He is a patron in
        hopeless situations and in an emergency.</p>

      <p>This statue once stood on the cemetery wall around the church in today's Republic Square. After the abolition
        of the cemetery in 1782, it was placed in front of the bridges over the MÅ¾e river at the end of today's Roosevelt
        Street. It is the only statue on the bridge, which is signed on the back by a sculptor, including the year 1745.
        Its author is the Pilsen baroque sculptor Lazar Widemann.</p>
